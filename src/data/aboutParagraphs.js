    "I started learning web development out of simple curiosity — I just wanted to understand how a website is built. I’ve always liked computers, but I never expected to enjoy coding as much as I do now. What began as an interest quickly became a passion.",

    "Before becoming a developer, I worked as a fitness trainer. Changing careers wasn’t easy, but it was a challenge I needed. I had already achieved everything I wanted in my previous field, and I felt it was time for something new — something that would push me to grow.",

    "Web development gave me exactly that: a new direction, a new level of creativity, and a new way to build things from scratch. I chose frontend development because I love the idea of designing and creating something from the ground up — like starting with a blank canvas.",

    "During my learning journey, I have focused mainly on React, combining structure, creativity, and problem-solving. I enjoy building real-world applications and improving my skills through hands-on projects.",

    "My strongest qualities are patience, persistence, and a genuine desire to succeed in whatever I choose to do. Becoming a developer was a conscious decision, and I am fully committed to putting in the work required to grow and improve every day.",

    "Looking ahead, my goal is to continue learning new technologies and best practices, because I believe that good code reflects good structure — and that is something I always aim for."
